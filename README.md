# toolbox

## Install
**Note**: When running setup.py you need to provide either "defensive" or "offensive" which will determine how the database is setup.
**Note**: sudo is used in setup.py to create a symlink for toolbox in /usr/local/bin.
```
git clone https://github.com/secw01f/toolbox
cd toolbox
python3 setup.py defensive
```

## Important
Before you install a module, make sure you install any python or other dependencies you need so that your module works!
